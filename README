Java code to illustrate Spring Framework's extensible XML authoring configuration. 
It has been built with Spring Framework version 3.1.0.M2. The code had been 
organised into three independent Eclipse projects:

1) springbean uses default spring bean configuration;

2) custombean utilises Spring's extensible XML authoring to specify a custom bean 
    definition;

3) customerdomain makes further use of XML authoring to define a complete 
    customised XML file.

A couple of Java programs have been included with each project above to provide 
examples, one signs a data file and the other verifies a given signature for a data file. 
These programs show that Spring beans have been created by custom XMLs through
the getBean() method.

Please note these classes are for illustration only and are not of production quality.
