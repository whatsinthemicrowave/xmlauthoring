Java code to illustrate Spring Framework's extensible XML authoring configuration. 
It has been built with Spring Framework version 3.1.0.M2. The code had been 
organised into three independent Eclipse projects:

1) springbean uses default spring bean configuration;

2) custombean utilises Spring's extensible XML authoring to specify a custom bean 
    definition;

3) customerdomain makes further use of XML authoring to define a complete 
    customised XML file.

A couple of Java classes have been included with each project above to provide 
configuration examples. These classes either sign a supplied data file or verify 
a given signature for a data file. Please note these classes are for illustration 
only and are not of production quality.
